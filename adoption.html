            <h2>Policy:</h2>
      			<p>To ensure the rabbits in our care go on to live happy lives we have a few measures put in place before you can adopt from Us.</p>
      			<p>To adopt through Wellington Rabbit Rescue you will need to have an inspection of your yard/enclosure/room to ensure it is big enough and secure enough from predators. (This may be done via photos in most cases)!</p>
      			<p>If you are using an enclosed area rather than having your rabbits free-range - then it must be a minimum size of 2 metres (length) 1 metre (width) and 1 metre (height) with a warm, dry covered area that is at least 61x61cm. Please note - this is MINIMUM. We prefer much, much more space than this.</p>
      			<p>The best option is to have your rabbits free-range in a securely fenced back yard, or free range in your home. Another great option is to attach a permanent run to an existing hutch so your rabbit always has the freedom to exercise whenever it wishes!</p>
      			<p>We endeavour to only rehome rabbits in pairs, unless of course they are going to be a companion to your existing rabbit. We feel it’s not fair to keep a rabbit all on his own as they are very social creatures and thrive with their own kind for company.</p>
      		</div>

      		<div id="priceing">
            <h2>Priceing:</h2>
      			<P>If you are adopting a rabbit as a companion for your existing rabbit then you will need to bring them out to have a meet &amp; greet with any WRR rabbit you would like to adopt! This is to ensure they will get along, we are happy to give you advice on how to bond rabbits.</P>
      			<P>Rabbits can live until they are 10-12 years. You need to be ready to care for your rabbit for this long. This includes annual health checks and vaccinations.</P>
      			<P>All of our rabbits are desexed and vaccinated before they will become available for adoption.</P>
      			<P>Our adoption fee is $80 for one rabbit or $140 for a pair. This money goes towards the cost of desexing, vaccinations &amp; other veterinary costs while in our care. (It costs us $140 for a male to be desexed &amp; $210 for a female and vaccinations are $25!)</P>
      			<P>When adopting a rabbit from us you will be given a care guide and receive continued support from us should you have any queries or questions.</P>
      			<P>If for some reason you can no longer care for your rabbit they must be returned to our care!
